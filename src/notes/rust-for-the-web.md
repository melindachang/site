I have been engineering software in some form for something like nine
years now. The vast majority of that period I have spent (a) building
JavaScript (TypeScript) applications or (b) writing code in other
languages meant to interoperate extensively with JavaScript and
TypeScript applications. Exactly two things have remained constant for
that time, and I am far from the first person to observe them:

1. _There is no running away from the web._ No other platform is as extensible.
2. JavaScript is a demonic language, and TypeScript is useful
   insofar as it expedites the process of Stockholm Syndrome.
3. With very few exceptions, the JavaScript ecosystem is hell on Earth.
